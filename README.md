============================================

A simple showcase of a Maven project using the Gatling plugin for Maven. Refer to the plugin documentation
[on the Gatling website](https://gatling.io/docs/current/extensions/maven_plugin/) for usage.

This project is written in Java,  

It includes:

* [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/), so that you can immediately run Maven with `./mvnw` without having
  to install it on your computer
* minimal `pom.xml`
* latest version of `io.gatling:gatling-maven-plugin` applied
* sample [Simulation](https://gatling.io/docs/gatling/reference/current/general/concepts/#simulation) class,
  demonstrating sufficient Gatling functionality
* proper source file layout


Maven Wrapper
-------------
Easy Maven installation: No need to install Maven on your system. The wrapper downloads and configures Maven automatically.
Project-specific Maven: Allows multiple projects to use different Maven versions without conflicts.
